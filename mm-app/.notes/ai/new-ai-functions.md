# Guide to Implementing New AI Features

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to implementing new AI features in our codebase, using existing implementations like `website-bio-extractor` and `analyze-artwork` as references.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define the Purpose and Input/Output:**
   - Clearly define the feature's purpose.
   - Identify required inputs and expected outputs.

2. **Set Up the AI Client:**
   - Use `UnifiedAIClient` for AI interactions.
   - Configure with necessary API keys and settings.

3. **Handle Input Validation:**
   - Validate and normalize inputs.

4. **Fetch and Process Data:**
   - Fetch necessary data and process it.
   - Use libraries like `cheerio` for HTML parsing if needed.

5. **Send AI Requests:**
   - Construct prompts and send requests to the AI client.
   - Handle different types of analysis or extraction.

6. **Process AI Responses:**
   - Handle AI responses and implement error handling.

7. **Return Results:**
   - Format and return results in a structured format.

8. **Logging and Debugging:**
   - Include logging statements for tracking and debugging.

## In-Depth Guide to Implementing New AI Features

1. **Architecture Overview:**
   - **Modular Design:** Each AI feature is encapsulated in its own module, promoting separation of concerns and reusability.
   - **Unified AI Client:** Centralizes AI interactions, allowing for easy configuration and switching between different AI providers.

2. **Configuration and Environment:**
   - **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage API keys and other sensitive configurations. This ensures security and flexibility across different environments (development, staging, production).
   - **AI Settings Management:** Implement a settings management system to dynamically configure AI providers and parameters like temperature and max tokens.

3. **Input Handling and Validation:**
   - **Robust Validation:** Implement thorough validation for all inputs to prevent errors and ensure data integrity. Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
   - **Normalization:** Normalize inputs to a standard format before processing, such as ensuring URLs have the correct protocol.

4. **Data Fetching and Preprocessing:**
   - **Efficient Data Fetching:** Use asynchronous operations to fetch data, ensuring non-blocking execution. Handle HTTP errors and retries as needed.
   - **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess data to extract relevant information. For HTML content, use libraries like `cheerio` for parsing and selecting elements.

5. **AI Interaction:**
   - **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully craft prompts to guide the AI in generating the desired output. Tailor prompts based on the type of analysis or extraction required.
   - **Response Handling:** Implement logic to handle AI responses, including parsing, validation, and error handling. Ensure responses meet the expected format and content.

6. **Post-Processing and Output Formatting:**
   - **Result Structuring:** Organize results into structured formats (e.g., JSON) for easy consumption by other parts of the application.
   - **Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement fallback mechanisms to handle cases where AI responses are empty or invalid, such as using preprocessed data as a backup.

7. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - **Comprehensive Logging:** Include detailed logging at each step to facilitate debugging and performance monitoring. Log inputs, outputs, and any errors encountered.
   - **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring and alerting systems to track the performance and reliability of AI features.

8. **Testing and Validation:**
   - **Unit and Integration Testing:** Develop comprehensive tests to validate the functionality and reliability of AI features. Use mock data and scenarios to simulate real-world conditions.
   - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and refine AI features based on user feedback and performance metrics.

By following these detailed guidelines, you can create robust and efficient AI features that integrate seamlessly with our existing system. Regularly review and update your implementations to align with best practices and technological advancements.
