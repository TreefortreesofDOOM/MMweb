# Meaning Machine

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

- Do not over engineer.
- Check for existing files before creating new ones.
- make sure you are in mm-app directory before running commands.
- Follow DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Apply YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, non-overlapping subtasks using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

```

## Constants Organization Rules
1. **File Names**
   - Use kebab-case for files
   - No suffix needed for env.ts
   - Use `-constants` suffix for other constant files
   - Group related constants by domain

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Keep all env validation in `env.ts`
   - Use Zod for schema validation
   - Include proper TypeScript types
   - Document required vs optional variables

3. **Constants Organization**
   - Group related constants together
   - Use 'as const' assertion
   - Export named constants
   - Include proper JSDoc documentation

## Types Organization Rules
1. **File Names**
   - Use kebab-case with `-types` suffix (e.g., `gallery-types.ts`)
   - Group related types in domain-specific files
   - Keep database types separate in `database.types.ts`

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Use interfaces for object shapes
   - Use type for unions and complex types
   - Avoid enums, use const objects with 'as const'
   - Export all types with clear, descriptive names

3. **Type Documentation**
   - Include JSDoc comments for complex types
   - Document type parameters
   - Add examples for non-obvious usage

## Utils Organization Rules
1. **Directory Structure**
   - Group utilities by domain/purpose
   - Keep core utilities separate from domain-specific ones
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns

2. **File Names**
   - Use kebab-case with `-utils` suffix (e.g., `image-utils.ts`)
   - Add domain prefix for domain-specific utilities
   - Use descriptive names that indicate functionality

3. **Function Organization**
   - Keep related functions together
   - Export named functions (no default exports)
   - Include proper TypeScript types
   - Add JSDoc documentation for complex functions

4. **Best Practices**
   - Follow DRY principles
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Include type definitions
   - Write unit tests for utilities

## Naming Conventions

1. **File Names**
   - Use kebab-case for all files (e.g., `artwork-card.tsx`, `search-utils.ts`)
   - Add `-utils` suffix for utility files (e.g., `common-utils.ts`)
   - Add domain prefix for domain-specific files (e.g., `stripe-client-utils.ts`)
   - Use descriptive names that indicate functionality

2. **Component Files**
   - Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `artwork-card.tsx`)
   - Export PascalCase component names (e.g., `export const ArtworkCard = ...`)
   - Group by feature in dedicated directories
   - Include type definitions

3. **Utility Files**
   - Add `-utils` suffix (e.g., `auth-utils.ts`)
   - Group related utilities in feature directories
   - Use domain prefixes when specific to a service

4. **Hook Files**
   - Use camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
   - Place in `/hooks` directory
   - One hook per file

## Supabase Client Patterns
Use the following patterns consistently for Supabase client initialization:

1. **Server Components & API Routes**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
const supabase = await createClient()
```

2. **Server Actions**
```typescript
import { createActionClient } from '@/lib/supabase/supabase-action'
const supabase = await createActionClient()
```

3. **Client Components**
```typescript
import { createBrowserClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'
const supabase = createBrowserClient()
```

> **Note:** All patterns use `@supabase/ssr` under the hood but with different cookie handling strategies appropriate for their context. Do not use the older `auth-helpers-nextjs` package.

## Component Organization
1. Group components by feature (e.g., `admin/`, `artwork/`, `auth/`)
2. Keep shared UI components in `ui/` directory
3. No loose components at root level
4. Follow consistent file naming patterns
5. Include proper type definitions
6. Export PascalCase component names

## Route Organization
1. Use route groups with parentheses for organization:
   - `(admin)/` - Protected admin routes
   - `(auth)/` - Authentication flow
   - `(protected)/` - Protected user routes
   - `(public)/` - Public pages
2. Keep API routes in `api/` directory
3. Maintain proper layouts for each group

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

## Project Context
This project involves integrating various features and services to create a comprehensive platform for artists and administrators. The key components include:

- **Stripe Integration**: Setting up Stripe for payment processing, including creating payment intents, handling webhooks, and managing artist payouts.
- **Artist Application Process**: Implementing a detailed application process for artists, including form submission, admin review, and notifications.
- **AI Gallery Assistant**: Setting up an AI-powered assistant using Google Cloud Multimodal Live API for real-time conversation and session management.
- **Admin and Artist Dashboards**: Creating dashboards for both admins and artists to manage applications, view sales history, and handle payouts.
- **Security and Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control, data validation, and rate limiting to ensure platform security and integrity.
