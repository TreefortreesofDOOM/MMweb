# AI System TODOs and Improvements

## Similarity Search Improvements

### Short Term
- [ ] Lower match threshold from 0.1 to 0.05 to get more results while maintaining quality
- [ ] Include more artwork metadata in search results (styles, techniques, keywords)
- [ ] Add more diverse test queries to validate different aspects:
  - Medium (painting, sculpture, digital, etc.)
  - Style (abstract, realistic, minimalist, etc.)
  - Emotion (serene, energetic, melancholic, etc.)
  - Subject matter (landscape, portrait, still life, etc.)
  - Color themes and composition

### Medium Term
- [ ] Implement result filtering by metadata (style, technique, price range, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for negative queries ("like X but not Y")
- [ ] Create a benchmark dataset for evaluating search quality
- [ ] Add relevance feedback mechanism (track which results users interact with)

### Long Term
- [ ] Explore multi-modal embeddings (combine text and image features)
- [ ] Implement personalized search results based on user preferences
- [ ] Add support for semantic search across multiple languages

## Embedding System

### Current Status
- Using Gemini embeddings (768 dimensions)
- Storing embeddings in `artwork_embeddings_gemini` table
- Generating embeddings for title, description, styles, techniques, and keywords

### Improvements
- [ ] Optimize embedding generation for batch operations
- [ ] Implement periodic reindexing of embeddings
- [ ] Add monitoring for embedding quality and coverage
- [ ] Consider adding image-based embeddings for visual similarity

## AI Agent Improvements

### Short Term
- [ ] Expand test coverage for different interaction scenarios
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add more detailed logging for debugging

### Medium Term
- [ ] Implement conversation memory for better context awareness
- [ ] Add support for more complex artwork queries
- [ ] Improve handling of edge cases and ambiguous requests

## Documentation Needs

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Document embedding generation process
- [ ] Document similarity search implementation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create guide for optimal artwork descriptions
- [ ] Document search query best practices
- [ ] Add examples of successful search strategies

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Short Term
- [ ] Track search query patterns
- [ ] Monitor embedding generation performance
- [ ] Track search result quality metrics

### Medium Term
- [ ] Implement automated quality checks
- [ ] Add performance monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up alerting for potential issues

## Testing and Validation

### Short Term
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for similarity search
- [ ] Add automated tests for embedding generation
- [ ] Implement validation for search results

### Medium Term
- [ ] Set up continuous testing pipeline
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework for search improvements
