# UI Issues in Profile Page

## 1. Duplicate Verification Information
- We're showing both the ValidationTracker and a separate RequirementsList component
- The "Verification Journey" card is redundant with the tracker information above it

## 2. Visual Hierarchy Issues 
- The profile image is positioned awkwardly in the middle of a large text block
- The bio text wraps around the profile image in an unstructured way

## 3. Layout Spacing
- The navigation sidebar appears to be too narrow
- The main content area has inconsistent padding/margins

## 4. Content Organization
- The bio text is one large block without proper paragraphing
- The profile section lacks clear visual separation from the verification section

## 5. Navigation Clarity
- The "Get Verified" link in the sidebar is present even though we're on the verification page
- The active state of the navigation isn't clearly indicated

## 6. Responsive Design
- The layout appears to be breaking at this viewport width
- The text flow around the profile image isn't optimized for different screen sizes
