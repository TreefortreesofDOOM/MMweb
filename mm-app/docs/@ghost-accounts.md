# Ghost Accounts Implementation Status

## Overview
Ghost accounts are automatically created for users who make purchases as guests. These accounts allow us to track purchase history and enable users to claim their past purchases when they create a full account.

## Database Schema
- ✅ Created `ghost_profiles` table
  - Stores basic information about guest purchasers
  - Links to claimed profiles when users register
  - Tracks total purchases and amount spent

- ✅ Enhanced `transactions` table
  - Added `ghost_profile_id` to link transactions to ghost profiles
  - Added detailed Stripe payment fields (billing info, card details, etc.)
  - Added RLS policies for secure access

## Data Import
- ✅ Created import script for historical Stripe data
- ✅ Successfully imported existing transactions:
  - Processed 100 payment intents
  - Created ghost profiles for all guest purchasers
  - Linked 98 successful transactions to ghost profiles
  - Each ghost profile (e.g., leej@leejhoward.com) has all their transactions linked via `ghost_profile_id`

## Admin Dashboard
- ✅ Implemented ghost profiles list view
  - Search by email or display name
  - View profile status (claimed/unclaimed)
  - Display total purchases and amount spent
  - Quick access to transactions

- ✅ Implemented transaction details view
  - View all transactions for a specific ghost profile
  - Display payment details (amount, status, card info)
  - Show profile summary with totals

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement ghost profile claiming process

  - Create UI for linking ghost profiles to new accounts
- [ ] Add ghost profile management features
  - Ability to manually link profiles
  - Handle duplicate profiles

## Security

  - Users can only view their claimed ghost profiles
  - Public can view visible ghost profiles (for marketplace features)

## Notes
- Ghost profiles are created automatically for guest purchases
