# Patron (Collector) Role Documentation

## Overview
The patron role's primary function is to maintain an automatic record of artworks purchased on Meaning Machine. When a patron buys an artwork, it's automatically added to their "Purchased Works" collection, creating an official record of ownership. As a secondary feature, patrons can also create custom collections for personal organization.
